This web-app was made using Ionic, a frontend web-application framework designed with easy cross-platform integration in mind, especially for touch screen devices.

This web-app was built to mimic the functionalities of an "AirBnb"-like app, with scrollable interfaces, infinite loading lists, and a GET/POST database integration running locally.

This was made at iExperience, a coding camp in Lisbon, Portugal in Summer 2019.

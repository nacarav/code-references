Nick Caravaggio Final Project
ncaravaggio

Program is initialized by running "view_main.py"!!!

####################IMPORTANT NOTE###############################
#This project will not work if you do not install the following modules:
#- Faker
#- nmap [function not available in current version]
#- python-nmap (Must have both!) [function not available in current version]
#- cryptography
#- scapy [function not available in current version]
#
# I installed these on command prompt by using: "py -m pip [module name]"
# If all of these installed and directories are set up good, everything works!

Original Roadmap plan:
- Create ktinker popup asking for a username and password to authenticate user.
- Allow user create an account if they dont have one.
- After logging in, see a list of buttons that offer different options to try, that all relate to cybersecurity.
- Button list;
1. Button 1: Package: "Faker" example. Pulls up a pop-up window that has a "generate" button, and a scrollable text area. Clicking generate will use faker's package and print a fake identity into the box.

2. Button 2: Prackage "nmap" example. Can be used to check open ports an inputted IP, can create a function that checks 255 and outputs only the ones that are open.

3. Button 3: Package "MultiFernet cryptography" example. See messages become encrypted, paste encryptions and see it get unencrypted. Can also be used to encrypt the user-created password in a .txt file to be later used for the login process.

4. Button 4: Package "Scapy" Exampe. Popup window that can print a summary of your requested amount of packages being read on your network.

5. Button 5: Ktinker example that uses an older project that sorts through an excel spreadsheet of video game sales, merging those functions into ktinker buttons.
